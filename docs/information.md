# ShareHouse Text Index

This file is the index for all textual content. Language-specific bodies live in:
- `docs/information.en.md` (English)
- `docs/information.ja.md` (日本語)

Rules:
- Each unique string appears once per language with source references.
- If a string appears in multiple places, list all source paths next to it.
- For other locales (fr/de/it/es/zh), refer to English until translated.

Sections to keep aligned across languages:
- Overview / Meta
- Navigation / Header
- Pages (Home, House Rules, Meetings, Events, Updates, Accounting, Settings, Auth)
- Components / Shared UI
- Emails & API messages
- Release notes / updates

The per-language files follow this order. Update them first; this index stays as a pointer.
